# marsCraters
This repo is dedicated to the Data Management and Visualization course offered by Wesleyan University though Coursera.

### Document Index:

1. *marsCraters selected Frequencies*: SAS output from initial univariate analysis of **DEPTH_RIMFLOOR_TOPOG** and **MORPHOLOGY_EJECTA_1**.  Includes only those records where Morphology_Ejecta_1 is non-empty.  

2. *marsPython.py* and *marsSAS.sas*: program files for python and SAS.  Programs are not identical, though both produce the roughly the same results.
