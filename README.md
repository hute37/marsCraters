# marsCraters
This repo is dedicated to the Data Management and Visualization course offered by Wesleyan University though Coursera.

### Document Index:

1. *marsCraters selected Frequencies*: SAS output from initial univariate analysis of **DEPTH_RIMFLOOR_TOPOG** and **MORPHOLOGY_EJECTA_1**.  Includes only those records where Morphology_Ejecta_1 is non-empty.  

2. *marsPython.py* and *marsSAS.sas*: program files for Python and SAS.  Programs are not identical, though both produce the roughly the same results.  

3. *marsCraters, Latitude*: Python output on latitude distribution.   

4. *marsPython2.py*: program file for Python.  Revised code focuses on relevant variables and includes data management items.  

5. *marsCraters, managed frequencies*: Python output (cleaned with markdown) from *marsPython2.py*.

6. *marsPython3.py*: program file for Python.  Revised code includes relevant variables, data management decisions, and graphical elements.  Excludes most frequency tables.  See *marsPython2.py* for those.
